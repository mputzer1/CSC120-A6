- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?


My initial impressions of how Inheritance affects my program are fairly positive. I can see how inheritance is incredibly useful since it prevents one from continually having to repeat the same code in different classes. It also allows different classes to be connected yet separate in that they aren't necessarily modifying each other (i.e. "child" doesn't modify the "parent" when modifying themself). In terms of what didn't work, I intially was confused by how to use super() in the constructor. I realized that within a constructor for a class, I don't actually need multiple "supers" for each string, int, etc. and can instead just have one. I was also a little confused about how to print the library's catalog in a pretty way because hashtable functionality is still slightly confusing to me.

However, in terms of what worked, I found the hashtable methods like put(), replace(), and remove() to be fairly straightforward and easy to use. When doing this assignment, I also found nesting the method for restock within the sellCoffee method to not actually be as hard as I initally thought it would be. Looking at in-class examples and applying them to this A6 assignment was very helpful and I would tell future students to make sure to review in-class examples before tackling new assignments.
